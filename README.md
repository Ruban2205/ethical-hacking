# Ethical Hacking

## Overview

This project focuses on ethical hacking practices, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking. Ethical hacking involves the authorized assessment of computer systems, networks, or applications to identify and address security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

## Objectives

1. **Authorization:** All testing is conducted with explicit permission from the system owner to distinguish ethical hacking from malicious activities.

2. **Scope:** The scope of the engagement is clearly defined, outlining the systems, networks, or applications authorized for testing to prevent unintended disruptions.

3. **Methodology:** Ethical hackers use various tools and techniques, including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and social engineering, to simulate real-world cyberattacks.

4. **Reporting:** Upon completion, detailed reports are provided to the organization, outlining discovered vulnerabilities, potential impacts, and recommendations for remediation.

5. **Continuous Improvement:** Ethical hacking is part of an ongoing cybersecurity strategy, including monitoring, regular security assessments, and updates to ensure resilience against emerging threats.

## Key Aspects

- **Identifying vulnerabilities:** Discovering weaknesses in the security infrastructure to prevent exploitation by malicious actors.

- **Assessing risk:** Understanding potential risks associated with systems and prioritizing mitigation efforts.

- **Strengthening security:** Recommendations contribute to improving the overall security posture of a system or network.

## Certification

Many ethical hackers obtain certifications such as Certified Ethical Hackers (CEH) to demonstrate expertise in ethical hacking practices.

## Usage

Please take a look at the project documentation for instructions on conducting ethical hacking assessments.
